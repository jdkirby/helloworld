Some interesting dialog that should be understandable:

    1. pick up the pick axe
        here we have a compound verb "pick up" and compound noun "pick axe".
        the dictionary must be able to be used based on the work "pick" which
        actually could be defined as a verb also but have a different meaning
        entirely.  other variations of this input could be:
            pick up pick
            grab the pick
            take the axe
            get ax
        many variations should be possible, but the parser should translate all
        the variations to the exact same canonical action.

For ANY Word:
    1. multiple definitions are allowed
